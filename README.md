# DataQ

DataQ is an MQTT Client for Axis cameras that enables custom data-driven solutions when standard camera data and formats are insufficient. It processes, filters, and transforms data before MQTT publishing to optimize resource usage.
Just like Axis Metadata, detections are based on DataQ makes integration and solution development very easy.  DataQ provides different data stractures based on use-case, optimizing bandwidth and alos adding pre-calculated properties like age, distance, direction and idle time so consumers does not need to.

## Key Features

## Data Types

### Events
Event-based triggers for actions, offering streamlined MQTT message publishing compared to standard Axis device capabilities.

### Object Analytics

**Detection Data**
- Real-time object detection
- Bounding box information
- Classification data
- High data throughput

**Tracker Data**
- Movement-based updates (and 2-second intervals)
- Direction, speed, and distance metrics
- Optimized bandwidth usage

**Path Data**
- Ideal for post-processing applications
  - Flow heatmaps
  - Dwell analysis
  - Forensic searching
  - Object counting
- Minimal bandwidth consumption and post processing needs

**Occupancy Data**
- Provides updates when number of detected objects in the scene changes
	- Queue management
	- Loitering

**Geospace Data**  
  
Geospace transforms the object detections x/y space in video to longitude and latitude. The technology used is homography.  
In order to get a good result, it is recommended that the calibration markers cover the area where objects move while maximizing the 4-corner area. It is also recommended to enable the camera's Barrel distortion correction (Menu | Installation | Image correction).  
You may add more than 4 markers if needed, but it may also make things worse.  

Geospace data uses Trackers for the transformations. Trackers do not need to be published but you may need to adjust both "Detections" and "Trackers".  
Recommended settings:  
* Enable the cameras Barrel distortion correction.
* Set Detections "Max idle" to 5 or 10 seconds to prevent sending location for stationary objects.
* Set Detection COG (Center-of-Gravity) to bottom-center.
* Disable all labels under Detections you are not interested in.
* Set Tracker "Minimum distance" to 5% or more to prevent stationary objects from being falsely detected as moving.

1. Click "Edit Markers".  
  - Use the mouse to move the map to the area the camera is located. Click "Save map"
  - Add 4 markers by clicking the left mouse in the video. A corresponding marker will be displayed in the map. 
	Move the markers to distinct positions (e.g. corner of a building)
	Marker is removed by right-clicking on the marker in the video view.  
  - Click "Save and calibrate"
2. Click "Verify"
  - Use the mouse and left-click in the video view. A marker will be shown in the map. See how well they correlate. You may need to go back to step 1 and adjust calibration.  
3. Click "Monitor"
  - Detected moving Objects will be displayed in both video and map view.

### Data Properties

| Property   | Type / Format | Description & Usage |
|------------|---------------|---------------------|
| **id**     | `string` | Unique tracking ID assigned per object during its lifetime in the scene. Used as a primary key when correlating updates. |
| **type**   | `string` or `int` | Internal object type code (implementation detail). Typically maps to a `class` but may be model‑specific. Usually not needed unless doing low‑level integrations. |
| **class**  | `string` | Semantic classification label (e.g., `"Person"`, `"Car"`, `"Bike"`, `"Bag"`). Primary field to identify object categories for business logic (counts, alerts, analytics). |
| **active** | `boolean` | Indicates whether the object is currently visible/trackable. Useful for knowing when objects have exited the scene. |
| **x, y, w, h** | `int` (pixels) | Bounding box rectangle: top‑left `(x,y)` position and box size `(w,h)`. Used to draw boxes in UIs or compute relative object size. |
| **cx, cy** | `int` (pixels, normalized 0–1000 optional) | Object’s positional anchor point (center or bottom‑center). Used for tracking paths, heat maps, and trajectory analyses. |
| **dx, dy** | `int` (pixels or normalized units) | Net displacement `(current − initial)` in X and Y directions. Indicates travel direction: `dx > 0 = right`, `dy > 0 = down`. Useful for direction/flow detection. |
| **birth**  | `int` (epoch seconds/milliseconds) | Timestamp when the object first appeared. Used for age/duration calculations. |
| **bx, by** | `int` (pixels) | Position coordinates where the object first entered the scene. Can be used for entry‑point analysis. |
| **age**    | `float` (seconds) | Time since first detection. Key metric for dwell time, stay duration, and filtering short vs long presence. |
| **idle**   | `float` (seconds) | How long the object has been stationary (resets on movement). Supports use cases like idle vehicle/person detection, abandoned luggage, or loitering alerts. |
| **confidence** | `int` (0–100) | Detection confidence score. Use thresholding to discard low-confidence objects and minimize false positives. |
| **timestamp**  | `int` (epoch seconds/milliseconds) | Last frame time where the object was seen. Useful for synchronization and gap detection. |
| **color, color2** | `string` (label) | Primary and secondary detected color labels (e.g., `"red"`, `"blue"`). Helps with descriptive analytics (red car, blue shirt). May be `null` if unavailable. |
| **path**   | `array` of objects | Sequence of position and dwell samples. Each entry contains `{x, y, d, lat?, lon?}`. Use to reconstruct trajectories, heatmaps, or identify where objects dwell most. |
| **lat, lon** | `float` (GPS coords) | Latitude/Longitude if a homography matrix is available. Enables geo‑position mapping in real-world coordinates instead of pixels. |
| **name**   | `string` | Camera name or location identifier (e.g., `"LobbyCam1"`). Useful for human-readable references. |
| **serial / device** | `string` | Unique hardware device identifier. Supports multi-camera/log correlation. |
| **localTime** | `string` (timestamp, local timezone) | Human‑readable local time when the event occurred. Useful for logs, reports, and non‑technical stakeholders. |

# History

Certainly! Here is a reviewed and improved version of your release notes for DataQ:

## History

### 2.0.2 July 14
- Fixed WEB GUI screw up, displaying the wrong index page.
  
### 2.0.0 July 14

- Major code refactoring for enhanced stability and future compatibility, especially across varying camera firmware versions.
  - Upgraded to SDK 12.2 (from SDK 3.5) for improved long-term support.
  - Switched MQTT library from synchronous to asynchronous, providing more robust reconnect and connection management.
  - Improved object detection pipeline to better accommodate firmware differences and prepare for upcoming changes.
- Introduced new `"idle"` property, which reports how long (in seconds) an object has remained stationary. This value resets when movement is detected.
- Occupancy analytics now allow you to count stationary objects, moving objects, or both, giving more flexibility and precision in reporting.

### 1.5.0	June 14, 2025

- Updated MQTT to use the MQTTAsync client.

### 1.4.6	May 14, 2025
- Fixed a bug that caused respawn of the ACAP

### 1.4.5	May 6, 2025
- Fixed MQTT reconnect issue

### 1.4.4	April 14, 2025
- Perodically force re-connection if needed as lostConnection may be missed

### 1.3.0	March 3, 2025
- Replaced "Max age" with "Max idle".

  Occupancy is impacted and will not count idle objects.  
  Path will be published when object is idle.  
- Restructuring GUI
